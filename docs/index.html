                    The goal of this repo is to generate data I can analyze to improve my strategies in card games.
                    Specifically my main interest is Texas Hold'em. The more data I can generate the better, and so
                    optimizing the runtime of the simulator is of upmost importance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>How can I generate data quickly?</b> Over the course of this paper I will attempt to outline my
                    solution to this question as it relates to Texas Hold'em.

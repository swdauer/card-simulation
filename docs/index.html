                    When thinking about poker it seems to me that there is a collection of possible strategies. Some of
                    these strategies are more profitable than others. Perhaps some are highly profitable when your
                    opponents' are deploying a specific strategy and unprofitable other times. What I want to know is
                    <b>(1) how to create a profitable strategy</b>, and <b>(2) how to change a strategy to increase
                        profitability depending on the actions of my opponents</b>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The goal of this repo is to generate data I can analyze to improve my strategies in card games.
                    Specifically my main interest is Texas Hold'em. The more data I can generate the better, and so
                    optimizing the runtime of the simulator is of upmost importance. Then the root question is
                    <strong>How
                        can I generate data quickly?</strong> Over the course of this paper I will attempt to outline my
                    solution to this question as it relates to Texas Hold'em.

                    My chosen representation of objects in the simulator is to have:
                <ul>
                    <li>a card type</li>
                    <li>a hand type which is a collection of cards</li>
                    <li>a deck type which is a collection of cards</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <section id="cardTypeRequirements">
                    <header>
                        <h4>Card Type Requirements</h4>
                    </header>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Determine the rank and suit of the card</li>
                        <li>Rank and suit need to have an equivalence operator. In other words I need to be able to
                            determine if two ranks are equal. The same is true for suits.</li>
                        <li>Ranks also need to have an order, which means I can determine if one rank is less than
                            another</li>
                    </ul>

                        For the hand type I need to be able to access the cards present in the hand.

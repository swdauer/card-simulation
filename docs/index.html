                <p>
                    The goal of this repo is to generate data I can analyze to improve my strategies in card games.
                    Specifically my main interest is Texas Hold'em. The more data I can generate the better, and so
                    optimizing the runtime of the simulator is of upmost importance. Then the root question is
                    <strong>How
                        can I generate data quickly?</strong> Over the course of this paper I will attempt to outline my
                    solution to this question as it relates to Texas Hold'em.

                    My chosen representation of objects in the simulator is to have:
                <ul>
                    <li>a card type</li>
                    <li>a hand type which is a collection of cards</li>
                    <li>a deck type which is a collection of cards</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Ranks and suits need to have an equivalence operator. In other words I need to be able to
                            determine if two ranks are equal. The same is true for suits.</li>
                        <li>Ranks also need to have an order, which means I can determine if one rank is less than
                            another</li>

                    For the card type I can group together a rank and a suit using a class or structure. Then
                    determining the rank and suit is as simple as accessing the rank and suit of a card. Since both rank
                    and suit need to have an equivalence operator it would be beneficial for me to use a type which is
                    quickly comparable such as an integer. Using an integer would also allow ranks to be easily ordered
                    as integers already have a less than operator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the deck type I can create an array of card types. This allows quick access and dealing with an
                    array index. Shuffling is also easy with an array as each element can be easily accessed and
                    swapped.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the surface, the hand type seems easy to implement as an array of card types just like the deck.
                    This would allow quick access of each card in the hand using array access. Likewise cards could be
                    easily added to the hand by just filling an empty slot in the hands containing array. There is,
                    however, still the operation of comparing hands to think about. This operation should be analyzed in
                    order to determine if the array representation of the hand type is a good solution, and so the next
                    sections will be mainly concerned with this analysis.

                <p>
                    The goal of this repo is to generate data I can analyze to improve my strategies in card games.
                    Specifically my main interest is Texas Hold'em. The more data I can generate the better, and so
                    optimizing the runtime of the simulator is of upmost importance. Then the root question is
                    <strong>How can I generate data quickly?</strong> Over the course of this paper I will attempt to
                    outline my solution to this question as it relates to Texas Hold'em.

                    My chosen representation of objects in the simulator is to have:
                <ul>
                    <li>a card type</li>
                    <li>a hand type which is a collection of cards</li>
                    <li>a deck type which is a collection of cards</li>

                        <li>Ranks also need to have an order, which means I can determine if one rank is less than

                    For the card type I can group together a rank and a suit using a class or structure. Then
                    determining the rank and suit is as simple as accessing the rank and suit of a card. Since both rank
                    and suit need to have an equivalence operator it would be beneficial for me to use a type which is
                    quickly comparable such as an integer. Using an integer would also allow ranks to be easily ordered
                    as integers already have a less than operator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the deck type I can create an array of card types. This allows quick access and dealing with an
                    array index. Shuffling is also easy with an array as each element can be easily accessed and
                    swapped.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the surface, the hand type seems easy to implement as an array of card types just like the deck.
                    This would allow quick access of each card in the hand using array access. Likewise cards could be
                    easily added to the hand by just filling an empty slot in the hands containing array. There is,
                    however, still the operation of comparing hands to think about. This operation should be analyzed in
                    order to determine if the array representation of the hand type is a good solution, and so the next
                    sections will be mainly concerned with this analysis.

                <p>
                    Comparing hands is a two phase problem. First I need to determine the best five card hand e.g.
                    flush, straight, three-of-a-kind. Second I need to compare the best five card hand of each larger
                    hand I'm trying to compare.

                    <p>
                        What is meant by "typing a hand" is determining what is the best five card hand of a larger
                        hand. This section will cover what is required to type a hand and how the operations scale with
                        the size of the hand. The difficulty here comes with the fact that checking if a hand has a
                        flush is a quite different operation that checking if a hand has a straight. I'll separate this
                        section into three sections and hopefully it will become clear to the reader why once this
                        section is completed.

                        <p>
                            The easiest way to find if a hand contains a flush is to iterate over the hand for each suit
                            and count the number. The time complexity of this is approximately
                            <math>
                                <mi>s</mi>
                                <mo>*</mo>
                                <mi>h</mi>
                            </math>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We could also create an array with length equal to
                            <math>
                                <mi>s</mi>
                            </math>
                            and store each suit count in each corresponding array element. This would allow us to
                            iterate over the hand only once. The time complexity of this is approximately
                            <math>
                                <mi>h</mi>
                            </math>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lastly we could sort the hand by suit then iterate over it. This would take only one
                            iteration like the latter method but would not need to store an array with size of
                            <math>
                                <mi>s</mi>

                            The time complexity of this is approximately
